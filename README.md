# RISCV Assembler and Simulator

## Overview
This project consists of two main components: an Assembler and a Simulator. The Assembler converts RISCV assembly code into binary machine code, while the Simulator reads and executes the binary code, printing the values of registers after each instruction and the state of memory at the end of execution.

## Features

### Assembler
- **Assembly to Binary Conversion**: Translates RISCV assembly instructions into binary code.
- **Syntax Checking**: Validates the syntax of the assembly code, ensuring it adheres to RISCV standards.
- **Error Handling**: Provides informative error messages for any syntax errors or unsupported instructions.

### Simulator
- **Binary Code Execution**: Reads and executes the binary code generated by the Assembler.
- **Register State Logging**: After each instruction, prints the values stored in each register.
- **Memory State Logging**: At the end of execution, prints the values of each memory location.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x (or any language/environment your project uses)
- RISCV assembly code input files
